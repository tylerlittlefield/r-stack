Run RStudio Server, Shiny Server and NGINX services with docker compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

**Note:** I have little experience with RStudio Server, Shiny Server, NGINX and Docker. This is a demonstration, use at your own risk! Feedback is welcome. Please submit an issue or PR if you'd like.
